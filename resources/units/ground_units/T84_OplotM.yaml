description: "The T-84 is a Ukrainian main battle tank (MBT), based on the Soviet T-80 MBT 
  introduced in 1976, specifically the diesel engine version: T-80UD. The T-84 was first built in 
  1994 and entered service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 1999. Its high-performance opposed-piston 
  engine makes it a fast tank, comparable to other modern MBTs with a power-to-weight ratio of about 
  26 horsepower per tonne (19 kW/t)."

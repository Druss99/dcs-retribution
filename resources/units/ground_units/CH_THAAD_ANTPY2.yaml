description: "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), formerly Theater High Altitude Area 
  Defense, is an American anti-ballistic missile defense system designed to intercept and 
  destroy short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase 
  (descent or reentry). The THAAD interceptor carries no warhead, instead relying on its 
  kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. THAAD was developed after the 
  experience of Iraq's Scud missile attacks during the Gulf War in 1991."

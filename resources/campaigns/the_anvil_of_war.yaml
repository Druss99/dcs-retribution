description:
  <p><strong>This is the finale to the three-part campaign series that begun with Afghanistan - Graveyard of Empires and Sinai - Red Sea Rising. 
  This campaign is intended to be run with CurrentHill's Russia, China, and Sweden Asset Packs installed, though this is not mandatory.</strong></p>
  <p>As NATO struggles to counter simultaneous crises in Afghanistan and the Middle East, the precarious balance of global power tilts further 
  toward instability. Russia and China, emboldened by their gains, now turn their attention northward, to Europe’s Arctic frontier.</p>
  <p>The Kola Peninsula, a critical hub of Russian military power, becomes the staging ground for an unprecedented joint Russo-Chinese offensive. 
  Their goals are clear - to dominate the Arctic shipping lanes, secure access to the region’s vast natural resources, and challenge NATO’s influence 
  in Scandinavia.</p>
  <p>Caught between the pincers of two challenging adversaries, NATO forces rally together in a bid to repel the invaders and preserve regional stability. 
  The fate of Europe hangs in the balance, as this new offensive threatens to forever alter the geopolitical map.</p>

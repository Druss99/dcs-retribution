description:
  <p>Operation Velvet Thunder is a high-intensity training exercise designed to 
  prepare fresh troops for the challenges they will face in Vietnam. The dense 
  jungle and rugged terrain of the Mariana Islands will provide a realistic 
  backdrop, allowing our forces to hone essential skills in jungle warfare, 
  unconventional tactics, and counterinsurgency operations. There are multiple 
  checkpoints scattered across the area of operations that will have to be 
  captured by Air Assault.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This campaign is intended to be played with the 
  A-4 Skyhawk, OV-10A, C-130J, and Vietnam War Vessels mods active. If the Vietnam 
  War Vessels is not active, the C-101CC will serve as a stand-in for the Skyraider 
  in order to provide an Armed Recon platform. Airbase threat range is set to 20 
  for this campaign to optimise autoplanner.</p>

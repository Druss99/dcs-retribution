description:
  <p><strong>This campaign is intended to be run with CurrentHill's USA Asset Pack installed, though this is not mandatory.</strong></p>
  <p>In the heart of the Middle East, the flamboyant and tyrannical Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen, 
  supreme leader of Wadiya, has once again defied international norms. Despite mounting global concerns 
  over his nation's nuclear ambitions (rumours of weapons-grade uranium refinement swirl like smoke 
  from a burning oil field), Aladeen has refused to comply with United Nations demands for transparency. 
  After months of diplomatic deadlock, the UN has voted to authorise military intervention to end the 
  threat posed by Wadiya's regime.</p>
  <p>A coalition of American and British forces, bolstered by an Australian contingent who were not 
  invited but turned up anyway, have been tasked with crippling Wadiya's military infrastructure, 
  dismantling the Wadiyan war machine, and putting an end to Aladeen's nuclear ambitions.</p>
  <p>Take to the skies and engage in high-stakes operations across Wadiya's outlandish and strategically 
  dubious facilities, including the Beard of Doom Rocket Test Range, the Nuclear Nadal Memorial Warhead 
  Design Lab, and the Wadiyan Ministry of Sports and Executions. Your task is to secure peace, freedom, 
  and of course, oil for the free world. Aladeen luck, Commander.

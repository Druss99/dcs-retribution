description:
  <p><strong>This campaign is intended to be run with Currenthill's Ukraine and Russia Asset Packs installed.</strong></p>
  <p>After years of brutal fighting, Ukraine has achieved the unthinkable - Crimea has been liberated. Now, the tide of war has turned, 
  and Kyiv has set its sights on destroying the Iskander missile launchers in Southern Russia that continue to threaten its territory. 
  Southern Russia's remaining air defences will need to be dismantled before this goal can be achieved. High priority secondary targets include 
  elements of the rail transportation network that are used to move ammunition, fuel, and reinforcements to frontline troops, as well as the 
  military airfields where Russia's fighter and bomber squadrons are based.</p>
